## Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/a586bf32fdfa4bb9b368a6b6543c4b50) for the resources below to get an estimate.

either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down --purge`.
