# Session 02 - Init `CosmosDB LC Vector Store` in the project

In this session, we will start creating the use of `CosmosDB LC vector store` to store the vectors generated by Azure OpenAI.

## Step 01 - Install packages

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore helps developers with a fully managed and scalable database, being compatible with MongoDB. In this part of the tutorial, we will be using Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore to store vector search resources.

> know more: **[Understand embeddings in Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings)**

Well, to start, let's install the following packages:

```bash
npm install mongodb @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Now, let's do the following, add the following code to the `package.json` file:

- `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a sample api demonstrating how to use Azure Functions with Azure OpenAI and LangChain.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "watch": "tsc -w",
    "clean": "rimraf dist",
    "prestart": "npm run clean && npm run build",
    "start:host": "npm run prestart && func start",
    "start": "npm-run-all --parallel start:host watch",
    "test": "echo \"No tests yet...\""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@azure/functions": "^4.0.0",
    "@langchain/azure-openai": "^0.0.2",
    "@langchain/community": "^0.0.36",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
    "langchain": "^0.1.25",
    "mongodb": "^6.5.0",
    "@langchain/core": "^0.1.44"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^18.x",
    "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5",
    "rimraf": "^5.0.0",
    "typescript": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "main": "dist/src/index.js"
}
```

## Step 02 - Create a CosmosDB for MongoDB vCore cluster using Azure Portal

Now we will need to create an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster. To do this, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial **[Quickstart: Create an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster by using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/quickstart-portal)**

After creating the cluster, we will need you to save the following information:

- `cluster name`
- `admin username`
- `password`
- `connection string`

When you create the cluster, you can find this information in the `Connection String` tab of your cluster.

After collecting this information, we'll include it in the project's `.env` file:

- `.env`

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT="<your_endpoint>"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your_deployment_name>"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_key>"

AZURE_COSMOSDB_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_connection_string>"
```

Where `<user>:<password>` is, you should replace it with: `<your-admin-username>:<your-password>`, which you created in the previous step.

Perfect! We already have our CosmosDB configured and ready to be used. Now let's move on to the next step!

Now that we have Azure CosmosDB configured and ready to be used in our project, let's get back to our code! Let's move on to the next step!
