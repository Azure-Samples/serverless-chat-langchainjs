This sample shows how to build a serverless ChatGPT-like experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation using [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) and Azure. The application is hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) and [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript), with [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/) as the vector database. You can use it as a starting point for building more complex AI applications.

<!--
> [!TIP]
> You can test this application locally without any cost using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Follow the instructions in the [Local Development](#local-development) section to get started.
-->

## Overview

This sample demonstrate how LangChain.js and Azure serverless technologies allows to quickly build an AI application. The application is a chatbot that uses a set of enterprise documents to generate the responses to user queries.

We provide sample data to make this sample ready to try. We use a fictitious company called _Contoso Real Estate_, and the experience allows its customers to ask support questions about the usage of its products. The sample data includes a set of documents that describes its terms of service, privacy policy and a support guide.

This application is made from multiple components:

- A web app made with a single chat web component built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) and hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview).

- A serverless API built with [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript) and using [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) to ingest the documents and generate responses to the user chat queries.

- A database to store the text extracted from the documents and the vectors generated by LangChain.js, using [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/).

- A file storage to store the source documents, using [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction).

## Get started

There are multiple ways to get started with this project.

The quickest way to use [GitHub Codespaces](#use-github-codespaces) that provides a preconfigured environment for you. Alternatively, you can [set up your local environment](#use-your-local-environment) following the instructions below.

<!-- > **Note**: If you want to run this sample entirely locally using Ollama, you have to follow the instructions in the [local environment](#use-your-local-environment) section. -->

### Use your local environment

You need to install following tools to work on your local machine:

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
<!-- - [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  - **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell command. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell. -->

<!--

Then you can get the project code:

1. Click on the **Fork** button at the top of this page to create your own copy of this repository.
1. Select the **Code** button, then the **Local** tab, and copy the URL of your forked repository.
1. Open a terminal and run this command to clone the repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`

### Use GitHub Codespaces

You can run this project directly in your browser by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=blue&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/serverless-ai-langchainjs?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main)

### Use a VSCode dev container

A similar option to Codespaces is VS Code Dev Containers, that will open the project in your local VS Code instance using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

You will also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine to run the container.

## Run the sample

### Run the sample locally with Ollama

### Run the sample locally with Azure OpenAI models

### Deploy the sample to Azure

#### Azure prerequisites

- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) to get free Azure credits to get started.

- **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply).

#### Deploy the sample

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run `azd up` to deploy the application to Azure.
3. When asked, you'll have to enter a name for the project and the location where you want to deploy the resources.

The deployment process will take a few minutes. Once it's done, you'll see the URL of the web app in the terminal.

TODO: screenshot
![Screenshot of the azd up command result](./docs/images/azd-up.png)

You can now open the web app in your browser and start chatting with the bot.

#### Clean up

To clean up all the Azure resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down --purge`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.
