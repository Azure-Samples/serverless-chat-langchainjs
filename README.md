This sample shows how to build a serverless ChatGPT-like with Retrieval-Augmented Generation AI application using the [LangChain.js library](https://js.langchain.com/) and Azure. The application is hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) and [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript), with [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/) as the vector database. You can use it as a starting point for building more complex AI applications.

<!--
> [!TIP]
> You can test this application locally without any cost using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Follow the instructions in the [Local Development](#local-development) section to get started.
-->

## Overview

This sample demonstrate how LangChain.js and Azure serverless technologies makes it easy to build a serverless AI application. The application is a chatbot that uses a set of enterprise documents to generate the responses to user queries.

We provide sample data to make this sample ready to try. We use a fictitious company called _Contoso Real Estate_, and the experience allows its customers to ask support questions about the usage of its products. The sample data includes a set of documents that describe its terms of service, privacy policy and a support guide.

</div>

This application is made from multiple components:

- A web app made with a single chat web component built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) and hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview).

- A serverless API built with [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript) that uses [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) to ingest the documents and generate responses to the user chat queries.

- A database to store the text extracted from the documents and the vectors generated by LangChain.js, using [Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/).

- A file storage to store the source documents, using [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction).

## Get started

There are multiple ways to get started with this project.

The quickest way to use [GitHub Codespaces](#use-github-codespaces) that provides a preconfigured environment for you. Alternatively, you can [set up your local environment](#use-your-local-environment) following the instructions below.

<!-- > **Note**: If you want to run this sample entirely locally using Ollama, you have to follow the instructions in the [local environment](#use-your-local-environment) section. -->

### Use GitHub Codespaces

You can run this project directly in your browser by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=blue&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/serverless-ai-langchainjs?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main)

### Use a VSCode dev container

A similar option to Codespaces is VS Code Dev Containers, that will open the project in your local VS Code instance using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

You will also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine to run the container.

### Use your local environment

You can also use your local environment to work on this project. To do so, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
<!-- - [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  - **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell command. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell. -->
